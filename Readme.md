# Getting start

### Database

It is not necessary to connect the online database. If this access is revoked, it can be used the local server with MySQL in the computer to get access.

To install the database, please, refer to the path:
> back-end/DB scripts

Then, execute in the same order all the scripts you will find.

It can also be tested the _online_ database which is provided by freemysqlhosting. The configuration can be reviewed under the following path:
> back.end/config/database-config.php

### Back-end

The API to provide responses should be deployed in your local server (WAMP/MAMP).

It is recommended to copy and paste the contained of the folder _back-end_ into a folder named **wikifilm** in the default path of the local server

_original_
> back-end/.....

_localhost-WAMP_
> www/wikifilm...

If the requests do not work when executed, it is possible to review also the setup in the client for WikiFilm application. Please, refer to the following path:
> front-end/wiki-film/src/app/services/wiki-film/wiki-film.service.ts

### Front-end

From the main root path where the angular application is installed (client app), the first time it will be required to install all the modules for Angular. To do so, execute the command:

`npm install`

Once all the dependencies are installed, it is possible to run the server to serve the application in a live browser:

`ng serve -o`
